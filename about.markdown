My name is Christopher Moravec, I am the CTO for 
[dymaptic](https://www.dymaptic.com) and maker of things.
Here you will find my musings about technology, projects that I have made and 
maybe even some pictures of interesting things.

I recently (April 9, 2023) started a YouTube Channel: [TheMorehavoc](https://Youtube.com/@TheMorehavoc)

You can also find me on Mastadon: <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@morehavoc">@morehavoc@fosstodon.org</a>
