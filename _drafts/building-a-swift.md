My friend, Bee, does a lot of knitting. She recently was debating if she should buy a [swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(textiles)) to help winding
balls of yarn. They are pretty cheap online, but I wanted to see if I could make one, so here comes an
Umbrella Swift!

# Research

I first looked at pictures of swifts, like these:

![An old style horizontal swift](/assets/images/building-a-swift/HorizontalSwift.jpg)

![A more modern umbrella style swift](/assets/images/building-a-swift/UmbrellaSwift.jpg)

Then I browsed Amazon. The basic design hasn't changed much, so I set about building a simple Umbrella Swift.

# The Process

I started by designing the top cap and the bottom of the umbrella in Fusion 360 and printing them on my 3D Printer.

## The bottom of the swift

Yes, they are all hexagons! Partially because this is _Bee_ we are talking about here, and also because [hexagons are the bestagaons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY).

## The Clamp

I had never designed or printed threads until this project, but I really wanted the clamp on the bottom to be 3D printed as well. Turns out it was Super Easy, Barely and Inconvenience! Really, I just used the Thread tool in Fusion 360, set it to "Modeled" and then just pushed back each of the three surfaces of the thread by 0.1 mm.

## Construction

I used a hardwood dowel as the shaft, and 15 inch bamboo "craft sticks" as all of the parts. A few random nuts and bolts here and there, some locktite, and of course my old friend hot glue to hold the top onto the shaft.

# Final Product
