I'm pretty into making custom things with my 3D printer these days. So when a random request comes in from a friend like:

> Hey, this little plastic tube I used to hold darning neadles broke, can you make me a new one?

I get excited. So I made a quick hexagonal tube, with a threaded lid!

The lid is a little too tall, so has too many threads. The number of times you turn it to remove the top is a little silly, but it works! Next time I would aim for just a fully turn to unscrew the lid.
