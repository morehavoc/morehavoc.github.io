# OctoPrint Saves Me From a Blue Screen of Death!

Recently my trusty Lulzbot Mini 3D Printer was having issues.. well actually the
old Windows laptop I used to run it was having issues. When I set out to replace 
the printer I stumbled upon OctoPrint, which not only saved my printer, but made it 
much better than it ever was before.

This is that story:

## A few more details for those that want to try this on their own

1. [I got the basic tutorial from here (I know instructables gets a bad wrap sometimes, but this was a great starting point!)](https://www.instructables.com/Octolibre-Running-Octoprint-on-the-Libre-Computers/) 
2. [An OctoPrint deploy script that made thigs much easier](https://github.com/paukstelis/octoprint_deploy/blob/master/octoprint_deploy.sh)
3. [The case I used, but only the bottom half](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3426091)
4. [Getting started with the Libre Potato board](https://hub.libre.computer/t/aml-s905x-cc-le-potato-overview-resources-and-guides/288)
5. I got my Libre board on Amazon.
6. Make sure you have a sufficient power supply otherwise the board might brownout while printing
